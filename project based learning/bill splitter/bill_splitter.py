## write a program that asks user to input their name
## and prints welcome + TheirName
userName = input("Enter your name\n")
print("welcome" + userName)

## get user hours and rate per hour and get the cross cost
hours = input("Enter hours")
rateHour = input("Enter your rate")
totalCost = int(hours) * float(rateHour)
print("total cost is " + str(totalCost))

## simplify
hour = int(input("Enter hours"))
rate = float(input("Enter your total rate"))
total = hour * rate
print("total cost ", total)
