# Chapter 5
# Lesson 1

# Machine Learning with Python
# IDE --> Jupyter lab (For this course. most recomended)
'''
    Steps in machine learning :
    1. import the data
    2. Clean the data 
    3. split data into 
        Training 
        Testing
    4. Create model
    5. Train the model
    6. Make predictions
'''

'''
    Machine Learning libraries:
    1. Numpy--> Multidimentional array library
    2. Pandas--> Data analysis library (Data frame--2D frame like spreadsheet)
    3. matplotlib --> 2-D plotting library for creating graphs and plots
    4. scikilearn--> provide most algorithim like:
                        decision trees
                        Neural network
